# Stream J — docs accuracy (plan 2026-09-27): one entry per merged PR

## Entries

- **J-1** Root README against the code. `vx run --frozen` was said to
  refuse a config changed since locking; it checks no staleness by
  design (`workspace/lockfile.ts` `frozenProjectConfig`, pinned by
  `tests/lock.test.ts` "a changed config file … --frozen keeps the
  freeze until re-lock"; reproduced: an edited config ran its locked
  form, exit 0, while `vx lock --check` exited 1). The comparison
  table's "fully cached, 100 pkgs" row (144 / 279 / 583+ ms) had no
  source in `benchmarks.md`; it now quotes the 3,270-task warm row
  (510 ms / 760 ms / 3.59 s). The stage table gains the `fingerprint`,
  `admit` and `setup`/`teardown` hooks (13 in `VxPlugin`, as the
  maturity table says). "~3,000 core tests" was ~4,200 declarations.
  `@vzn/vx-migrate` was listed twice. `parity.md` named a flag that does
  not exist (`vx lock --frozen`).

## Leads for other streams

- **C** `orchestrator/prepare.ts:242` says frozen configs load "after a
  content-hash tripwire"; there is none (`frozenProjectConfig` checks
  nothing, by design). The comment claims a guarantee the code lacks.
- **C** `orchestrator/plugin.ts:75` (`graph` hook doc) says a plugin may
  "adjust resources"; task resources went with the reservations on
  2026-09-12 and `TaskNode` carries none.
